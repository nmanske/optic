opper
=====

Refresh yourself on what those elusive options do, hassle free!

Example
-------

View the descriptions of -xcf and --format in the given order:

    opper tar xcf format

Notes
-----

For the sake of my sanity, I will refer to the optional arguments for this
program as flags, and the positional arguments as options.

Installing
==========

opper is installed using pip for Python 3. By default your local pip tool may be 
linked to Python 2. To be safe run the following command:

    sudo pip3 install opper

If the pip3 command is not found install the package with:

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip

Note that the above command will only work on Debian-based systems.
